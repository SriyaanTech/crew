# CrewDesk – Crew Management System (Frontend)

React 19 + Vite frontend for the Integrated Crew Management System (Merchant Navy).
Built against the project scope document: all 14 functional modules, the crew self-service
portal, role-based access, reports with Excel/PDF/CSV export, and audit trail.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # production build in dist/
```

Requires Node 20+.

## Demo mode (no backend)

With `VITE_API_URL` empty, the app runs on realistic sample data (≈150 seafarers, 8 vessels,
vacancies, contracts, payroll…) stored in your browser's localStorage. Everything you create or
edit persists until you click **Settings → Reset demo data**.

**Login:** pick any demo account chip on the login screen; any password with 4+ characters works.
Accounts marked 🔐 (Super Admin, HR, Crewing) ask for an MFA code — enter any 6 digits.
Switch to **Crew Portal** on the login screen to sign in as a seafarer.

## Connecting the backend

The Node + MySQL backend is in `../backend` (see the main README).
`.env` sets `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api`. Remove the value (leave it empty) to go back to demo mode.
All data access goes through `src/api/client.js`.

## Project structure

```
src/
  api/
    client.js        ← single data layer: mock store OR REST (switch via VITE_API_URL)
    mockStore.js     ← localStorage DB + audit logging (demo only)
    mockData.js      ← seed generator (demo only)
    hooks.js         ← useData('crew','vessels'…), useConfig('settings')
  config/
    constants.js     ← ranks, departments, document types, statuses
    permissions.js   ← modules, actions, default role → permission matrix
    crewFields.js    ← crew form + duplicate detection
    training.js      ← mandatory-course rules
  context/           ← Auth (RBAC, MFA, session timeout), Lookups (crew/vessel maps)
  components/        ← DataTable, FormModal, ResourcePage (generic CRUD), Layout, UI kit
  pages/             ← one file per module
  pages/portal/      ← crew self-service portal
  utils/             ← formatting, Excel/PDF/CSV export, PDF letters (offer, contract, payslip, joining)
```
